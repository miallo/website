Welcome to yet another website. Here we'll collect a bunch of tips and tricks
about the version control system `git`. The first years in uni I used git like
an annoying version of Dropbox - you only have a single branch and if you are
collaborating with others, or forgot to sync your changes from your laptop to
the university computer and you run into a merge conflict, you basically do a
reset and apply the changes manually again. Did this work? _Kinda…_ Did this
use the actually useful parts of git which can bring a real benefit?
_Definitely no!_ Do I even know 5% of what git can do? No, but I am willing to
learn –- if you have an idea about a workflow/command that is interesting: let
me know via Mastodon at
